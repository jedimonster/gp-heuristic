========================================
Competition website: http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/wjaskowski/game-2048-competition-gecco-2015

Prerequisites
-------------
Java 8.

Building
--------
You do not need to build the code. Just download the prebuild [2048.jar](https://github.com/wjaskowski/2048-gecco-2015-competition/releases/latest)

If you want to build it yourself, you need Maven. Just execute:

```bash
> mvn package
```

Preparing your agent
--------------------
A simple examplary controller (MyAgent.java):
```java
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Random;
import put.game2048.*;

public class MyAgent implements Agent {
	public Random random = new Random(123);

	// A nonparametric constructor is required

    /** timeLimit will always be 1 ms */
	public Action chooseAction(Board board, List<Action> possibleActions, Duration timeLimit) {
	    // Prefer right direction
	    if (possibleActions.contains(Action.RIGHT)) {
	        return Action.RIGHT;
        } else {
            // If cannot go right, then make a random move
            return possibleActions.get(random.nextInt(possibleActions.size()));
        }
	}
}
```

First, compile the agent:
```bash
> javac -cp 2048.jar MyAgent.java
```

Then, put it into a jar:
```bash
> jar -cf MyAgent.jar MyAgent.class
```

Finally, evaluate it:
```bash
> java -jar 2048.jar MyAgent.jar MyAgent 10000 1.0 123
MeanScore,95ConfInterval,MaxScore,AvgActionTime[ms],16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8912,16384,32768,65536
1249.4,11.3,5320.0,0.000,1.000,0.999,0.957,0.623,0.104,0.001,0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000,0.000
```

The values at the end of the resulting row are the percentages of games in which the controller achieved a tile of a given value.
